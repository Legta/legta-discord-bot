This is just a test project for now to see what I can do and to motivate myself by doing relatively simple things and adding more features so I can learn.

Uses discord.js ^14.14.1 and npm version 10.3.0

I will keep adding info here as I develop the bot.

Currently, the dependencies for this project are Node.js, discord.js ^14.14.1, @google/genai, and jimp.

The config file which holds the bot's token is ignored so it is not uploaded to GitHub, as well as the guild-data folder which contains server reactions and is generated by the bot when needed.

There are currently 11 slash commands:

- add-reply.js: Used to add a reaction or reply that is triggered by the specified content in a message.
- addemoji.js: Creates a new emoji in the server
- askgemini.js: Uses Google Gemini to generate a response to the provided prompt
- botavatar.js: Shows the avatar of the bot
- chiikawa.js
- defamation.js: Contacts HermahsAPI to retrieve a humiliating picture and posts it
- fortune.js
- generate.js: Uses StableHorde's API to generate an image with generative models
- nowplaying.js: Displays either the user's or any other specified user's now playing song on Spotify
- quote.js
- show-reply.js: Displays a list of all the reactions added with add-reply.js in the server, providing options to edit or delete
