This is just a test project for now to see what I can do and to motivate myself by doing relatively simple things and adding more features so I can learn.

Uses discord.js v14 and npm version 10.3.0

I will keep adding info here as I develop the bot.

Currently, the dependencies for this project are Node.js, discord.js v14.

The config file which holds the bot's token is ignored so it is not uploaded to GitHub, as well as the guild-data folder which contains server reactions and is generated by the bot when needed.

There are currently 9 slash commands:

- add-reply.js: Used to add a reaction or reply that is triggered by the specified content in a message.
- addemoji.js: Creates a new emoji in the server
- ask.js: Uses an LLM to generate a response to the provided prompt
- askgemini.js: Uses Google Gemini to generate a response to the provided prompt
- botavatar.js: Shows the avatar of the bot
- defamation.js: Contacts HermahsAPI to retrieve a humiliating picture and posts it
- generate.js: Uses StableHorde's API to generate an image with generative models
- nowplaying.js: Displays either the user's or any other specified user's now playing song on Spotify
- show-reply.js: Displays a list of all the reactions added with add-reply.js in the server, providing options to edit or delete
