This is just a test project for now to see what I can do and to motivate myself by doing relatively simple things and adding more features so I can learn.

Uses discord.js v14 and npm version 10.3.0

I will keep adding info here as I develop the bot.

Currently, the dependencies for this project are Node.js, discord.js v14.

The config file which holds the bot's token is ignored so it is not uploaded to GitHub, as well as the guild-data folder which contains server reactions and is generated by the bot when needed.
